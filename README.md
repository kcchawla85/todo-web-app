# To-Do App (Version 2)

Welcome to Version 2 of the To-Do App! This project is built using Node.js, Express.js, EJS, MongoDB, Mongoose, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows you to manage your tasks efficiently by providing a dynamic and interactive interface.

## Key Features:

- **Current Day Display:** The app automatically displays the current day, so you can keep track of your tasks with ease.

- **Create Custom Lists:** You can now create custom lists by simply typing `https://localhost:3000/nameofthelist` in your browser. This feature allows you to maintain different lists for various categories or projects.

- **Add and Delete Tasks:** Easily add tasks to your lists and delete completed or irrelevant tasks to keep your lists organized.

- **MongoDB Integration:** The app is now connected to a MongoDB database, ensuring your tasks are securely stored and can be accessed across different sessions.
