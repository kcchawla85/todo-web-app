# To-Do App (Version 1)

This is Version 1 of a simple To-Do app built using Node.js, Express.js, EJS, HTML, and CSS. The app allows users to manage their tasks by adding items to two independent lists - a general to-do list and a work-specific to-do list. In this version, the app can display the current day and users can add items to the lists.
